- **NO API keys needed!** Everything runs locally

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Install FFmpeg

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
# Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd discord-voice-moderator
npm install
```

### 3. Create Discord Bot

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click "New Application"
3. Go to "Bot" section ‚Üí "Add Bot"
4. Enable these Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - ‚úÖ **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**
   - ‚úÖ **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**
5. Copy the bot token

### 4. Configure Bot

Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Add your Discord bot token:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
AUTO_MONITOR=false
```

**AUTO_MONITOR options**:
- `false` = Manual control with `!monitor` command
- `true` = Auto-join when users enter voice channels

### 5. Customize Moderation Rules

Edit `bot.js` (lines 30-35):
```javascript
const BANNED_PHRASES = [
  'your banned',
  'words here',
  'inappropriate content',
];
```

### 6. Invite Bot to Server

Use this URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`):
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=19530752&scope=bot
```

Required permissions:
- Connect
- Speak
- Use Voice Activity
- Kick Members
- Send Messages
- Read Message History

## üéÆ Usage

### Start the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

First run will download the Whisper model (~100MB) - this happens once.

### Commands (Admin Only)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!monitor` | Join and monitor your current voice channel |
| `!stop` | Stop monitoring your current voice channel |
| `!stopall` | Stop monitoring ALL voice channels |
| `!status` | Show which channels are being monitored |
| `!testlog` | Send a test message to the log channel |
| `!setlogs #channel` | Set which channel receives violation logs |

### How It Works

1. Bot joins voice channel(s)
2. Listens to each user speaking
3. Converts speech to text locally (FREE!)
4. Checks text for banned phrases
5. Takes action if violation detected:
   - Kicks user from voice
   - Logs to #mod-logs channel (with full transcript)
   - Sends DM warning to user

## üìä Logging System

### Create a Log Channel

Create a text channel named one of:
- `mod-logs` ‚≠ê (recommended)
- `moderation`
- `voice-logs`
- `logs`

The bot will automatically find it and send violation reports there!

### Test Your Logs

```bash
!testlog
```

This sends a test message to verify logging is working.

### Violation Log Format

When someone violates rules, mods see an **interactive message** with action buttons:

```
üö® Voice Moderation Alert

üë§ User: BadUser#1234 (123456789)
üìç Channel: Gaming Voice
‚ö†Ô∏è Violation: Used banned phrase: `bad word`
üìù Full Transcript: "what the user actually said"
‚è≥ Status: Awaiting moderator action...

[ü¶µ Kick from Voice] [‚è∞ Timeout (5m)] [üî® Ban User] [‚ö†Ô∏è Warn Only] [‚úÖ Ignore]
```

**Moderators click a button** to choose the action:
- ü¶µ **Kick from Voice** - Remove from voice channel
- ‚è∞ **Timeout** - 5-minute timeout + voice kick
- üî® **Ban** - Permanently ban from server
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warn** - Send DM warning only
- ‚úÖ **Ignore** - No action (false positive)

After clicking, the message updates with the action taken and who did it.

**See [MODERATION_ACTIONS.md](MODERATION_ACTIONS.md) for complete action guide.**

## üîß Multi-Channel Support

The bot can monitor **multiple voice channels simultaneously**:

```bash
# Admin in Channel 1
!monitor

# Admin in Channel 2  
!monitor

# Admin in Channel 3
!monitor

# Check status
!status
# Output: Monitoring 3 channel(s)
```

Each channel is processed independently with its own connection.

## üìä Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monitor Multiple Channels
```
User A joins "Gaming Chat" ‚Üí Admin types !monitor
User B joins "Music Chat" ‚Üí Admin types !monitor
Bot now monitors both channels simultaneously
```

### Scenario 2: Automatic Violation Handling
```
User says banned phrase in "Gaming Chat"
‚Üí Bot transcribes: "user said bad word"
‚Üí Bot detects violation
‚Üí User kicked from voice
‚Üí Log sent to #mod-logs
```

### Scenario 3: Stop Specific Channel
```
Admin in "Gaming Chat" types !stop
‚Üí Bot leaves "Gaming Chat"
‚Üí Bot continues monitoring "Music Chat"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Moderation Mode

Choose how violations are handled:

```env
# .env file

# Manual mode - Moderators click buttons to choose action (recommended)
AUTO_ACTION=manual

# Auto modes - Bot takes action automatically:
AUTO_ACTION=auto-kick      # Auto-kick from voice
AUTO_ACTION=auto-timeout   # Auto-timeout for 5 minutes
AUTO_ACTION=auto-ban       # Auto-ban from server  
AUTO_ACTION=auto-warn      # Send warning DM only
```

**See [MODERATION_ACTIONS.md](MODERATION_ACTIONS.md) for detailed action guide.**

### Adjust Silence Detection

In `bot.js` ‚Üí `listenToUser()`:
```javascript
end: {
  behavior: EndBehaviorType.AfterSilence,
  duration: 1000  // milliseconds (1 second)
}
```

### Audio Quality Settings

In `bot.js` ‚Üí `listenToUser()`:
```javascript
const decoder = new prism.opus.Decoder({
  rate: 48000,     // Sample rate
  channels: 2,     // Stereo
  frameSize: 960   // Frame size
});
```

### Change Whisper Model

In `bot.js` ‚Üí `initializeWhisper()`:
```javascript
// Options (from fastest/least accurate to slowest/most accurate):
// 'Xenova/whisper-tiny.en'      ‚Üê Default (fast, good for real-time)
// 'Xenova/whisper-base.en'      ‚Üê Better accuracy
// 'Xenova/whisper-small.en'     ‚Üê Best accuracy (slower)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't hear audio
- Ensure bot has "Connect" and "Speak" permissions
- Check voice channel isn't at user limit
- Verify `selfDeaf: false` in code

### Model loading is slow
- First run downloads model (~100MB)
- Model is cached locally after first download
- Subsequent runs are fast

### FFmpeg errors
```bash
# Check FFmpeg is installed
ffmpeg -version

# Ensure it's in PATH
which ffmpeg  # Linux/Mac
where ffmpeg  # Windows
```

### Bot crashes on multiple channels
- Check system resources (CPU/RAM)
- Consider using faster Whisper model
- Increase silence detection duration

## üí° Performance Tips

1. **Model Selection**: Use `whisper-tiny.en` for real-time (default)
2. **Silence Duration**: Increase to reduce processing load
3. **Channel Limit**: Monitor 3-5 channels max per bot instance
4. **Hardware**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended

## üîí Legal & Privacy

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warnings**:

1. **Recording Laws**: Voice recording may be illegal without consent in your jurisdiction
2. **User Notice**: Always inform users they are being recorded
3. **Data Privacy**: Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and local privacy laws
4. **Discord TOS**: Ensure compliance with Discord's Terms of Service
5. **Consent**: Consider requiring user consent before monitoring

**Recommended**: Add a message when bot joins:
```
"‚ö†Ô∏è This voice channel is being monitored for moderation purposes. 
By staying in this channel, you consent to audio monitoring."
```
