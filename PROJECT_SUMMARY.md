- **Size**: ~100MB (downloaded once)
- **Speed**: Fast enough for real-time
- **Accuracy**: Good for most use cases
- **Upgrade**: Can use larger models for better accuracy

### Audio Processing
```
User speaks → PCM audio captured → 
Convert to WAV → Local Whisper transcription →
Text check → Action taken
```

## 📋 Setup Requirements

1. **Node.js 16+**
2. **FFmpeg** (for audio conversion)
3. **Discord Bot Token**
4. **2-4GB RAM** (for multiple channels)
5. **~200MB disk space** (for AI model)

## 🎮 Usage Example

### Scenario: Gaming Server with 3 Voice Channels

Server Owner:
1. Joins "General Voice"
2. Types !monitor
3. Joins "Gaming 1"

5. Joins "Gaming 2"
6. Types !monitor

Bot now monitors all 3 channels:

const BANNED_PHRASES = [
  'bad word 1',
  'bad word 2',
  'offensive phrase'
];
```

### AI Model Options
```javascript
// Faster but less accurate:
'Xenova/whisper-tiny.en'   // ← Default

// Slower but more accurate:
'Xenova/whisper-base.en'   // Better
'Xenova/whisper-small.en'  // Best
```

## 🛡️ Moderation Features

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't hear audio

```

### Model loading slow
```bash
# First run downloads model (~100MB)
# Subsequent runs are instant
# Check internet connection on first run
```

### Multiple channel crashes
```bash
# Check RAM usage
free -h

# Reduce monitored channels
# Use faster model (whisper-tiny)
# Increase silence detection duration
```
